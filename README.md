## Usage
This application allows users to track various burgers that have and have not been devoured. They have the option to devour a burger already showing on the Burgers Not Devoured list, or even prepare another from the Devoured Burgers list. Users can also add in new burgers that are not already on the list and even choose to devour them immediately or place on the Burgers Not Devoured list and save for later.
